## Usage

### ES Modules in Node

Used ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like

```
NODE_ENV = development

JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id
```
Create a .env file inside frontend and add the following

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_KEY = "add google map api key"
```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)
